# solving-trivia

Let's solve a trivia problem. Write code to algorithmically solve the following trivia questions!

#### Note: open the .xcworkspace, NOT the .xcodeproj

## Instructions

Write all of your code in the `solveTrivia` method. 
It should return the answer to this trivia question:

**What is the only state who's capital contains none of the characters as the state name?** (for example Alaska isn't the answer because Juneau and Alaska both have an A)

## Hints

  * Is there a way to split a string into characters?
